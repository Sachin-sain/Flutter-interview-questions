Ans:-The lifecycle has the following simplified steps:
 createState() mounted == true initState() didChangeDependencies() build() didUpdateWidget() setState() deactivate() dispose() mounted == false
life cycle

2.What is Flutter tree shaking (flutter web)?=>

Ans:-When compiling a Flutter web application, the JavaScript bundle is generated by the dart2js compiler.
 Tree shaking is the process of eliminating dead code, by only including code that is guaranteed to be executed.

Navigation and routing are some of the core concepts of all mobile application, which allows the user to move between different pages.
 We know that every mobile application contains several screens for displaying different types of information.
 For example, an app can have a screen that contains various products.
 When the user taps on that product, immediately it will display detailed information about that product

8.Explain async, await and Future?=>

9.how can you update a listview dynamically?=>

Ans:-By using setState to update the listview.

10.What is a Stream?=>

Ans:-A stream is like a pipe, you put a value on the one end and if there’s a listener on the other end that listener will receive that value.
 A Stream can have multiple listeners and all of those listeners will receive the same value when it’s put in the pipeline. 
The way you put values on a stream is by using a StreamController.

11.What are GlobalKeys?=>

Ans:- They allow widgets to change parents anywhere in your app without losing state,.
 An example of the first scenario might if you wanted to show the same widget on two different screens, but holding all the same state, you’d want to use a GlobalKey.

12.When can you use double.INFINITY?=>(ydi hmare pas parent widget ka size bda h to hum double.infinity ka use karke usme another widget ko add kar sakte h)

21.How to convert a List into a Map in Dart?=>(https://www.bezkoder.com/dart-convert-list-map/)

Ans:-(exit(0) : This command also works but it is not recommended because it terminates the
 Dart VM process immediately and users may think that the app got crashed.)

24.why is flutter used of dart?=>
Ans:-Dart has a declarative and programmable layout that is easy to read and visualize.

25.What is the difference between final and const in Flutter?=>(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75ytmgbDUfo&t=11s)

 Use the LayoutBuilder class.
 From its builder property, you get a BoxConstraints object.

43.Explain async, await , (then and Future) keyword?=>
44.Use of yeild keyword?=>
Ans:-yield adds a value to the output stream of the surrounding async* function.

45.What's the difference between async(note) and async*(async* will always return a Stream through the yield function) in Dart?
46.What are the ways to use Future Object?=>(using the . then function)
47.How to group multiple Strem?

58.How to use Bloc architecture?=>( BloC architecture:
 You need to connect your widget to the data layer and make it communicate with a service,API or a repository.)

59.How to use MVVM architecture?=>

63.Difference between getDocuments() vs snapshots() in Firebase?=>
Ans:-getDocuments is a type of Future 
     getDocuments()

getUserById(String userId) async {
    return await _firestore.collection("users").where("userId", isEqualTo: userId).getDocuments();
}

   snapshot is a type of stream
   I am a little confused about the difference between these two. My understanding is that getDocuments is a type of Future and seems to get the entire documents according to the query. while snapshots, on the other hand, is a type of Stream and, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it represents the results of the query? I need a more specific explanation of this issue. I will include some code snippets as an example for more clarification

getDocuments()

getUserById(String userId) async {
    return await _firestore.collection("users").where("userId", isEqualTo: userId).getDocuments();
}

snapshots()

getUserById(String userId) async {
    return await _firestore.collection("users").where("userId", isEqualTo: userId).snapshots

64.Use of export keyword?=>
Ans:-What is export in Dart?
When you create a new library and use other libraries you want to make available automatically when using your package, then you use export : library mylib; export 'otherlib.dart'; 
You can use the show keyword to import/export only some parts of a library (like a class or something).
